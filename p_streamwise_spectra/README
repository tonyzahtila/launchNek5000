  To compute the 1d pre-multiplied spectra.
  
  The process for computing spectra is more involved.
  
  #EDIT THE .usr file.
  
      1. Copy the lines [17,22] to your .usr file.
      2. Copy line [4] to your .usr file.
      3. Copy the lines [119,120] to your .usr file.
      4. Copy the lines [143,155] to your .usr file.
      5. Copy the lines [283,341] to your .usr file.
 
  The modifications you have made to your .usr file wil output the streamwise velocity on a spectrally interpolated regular grid.
  
  Now,
  
  1. Create the folder 'spectra' in your case directory (i.e, same directory as where is your .usr file)
  2. Modify line 10 in the file 'compute_spectra.py' to your case directory. 
  3. Modify line 93 of the file 'compute_spectra.py' to your viscosity.
  4. Submit the python_run job to spartan.
  
  This script will take the spectrally interpolated grids, compute a 1D profile for each time step, store it in the 'spectra' folder, 
    and then delete the regularly interpolated grid.
