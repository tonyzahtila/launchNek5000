To gather slice:

  1. copy lines [21,25] to your .usr file
  2. change INTP_SLICE to 1
  3. copy lines [119,133] to userchk file. Also make sure parameter(nstat=25) precedes this block.
  4. copy lines [362,406] to somewhere in your userchk subroutine
  5. Change iostep to 2, or whatever write control you have. The slice will be output during write time.
  
To go back to old mode:

  1. change INTP_SLICE to 0
  2. change your iostep or write control to something sensible
