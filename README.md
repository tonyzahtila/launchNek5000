Channel
  - channel_slice:        Create a slice with visualiation through spectral interpolation on a regular grid, able to decide he number of points to determine resolution.

  - streamwise_ruu:       Compute the streamwise autocorrelation at a wall-normal distance.

  - skewness/flatness:    Compute the 1D skewness/flatness profiles

  - streamwise spectra:   Compute the 1D streamwise pre-multiplied energy spectra.

Pipe
  - feedback:   Compute the 1D mean feedback force in the pipe from the PPICLF particles.
